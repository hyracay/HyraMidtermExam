          Our vision is to empower Pokémon trainers by providing them with a powerful and intuitive tool that helps them understand the intricate interactions between different Pokémon types. 
          We aim to enhance the strategic gameplay experience by enabling trainers to make informed decisions during battles and team-building.

          Our mission is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly Pokémon Types Synergy Calculator that allows trainers to input their Pokémon team compositions and opposing Pokémon types. 
          Through accurate calculations and visualizations, we will provide insights into type advantages, weaknesses, and overall synergy. 
          Our goal is to foster a community of knowledgeable and skilled trainers who can maximize their chances of victory in battles.
